- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaellindholmdk / LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellindholmnielsen/
- 👀 I’m interested in creating valuable business insights using data and logic. With a background in physics and astronomy I have a strong focus on problem solving and disseminating useful knowledge to stakeholders.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring opportunities to create efficient analysis using Python Pandas and SQL. I have previously dabbled in MATLAB and a bit of C++ programming. Feel free to check out my retired MathWorks FE profile at https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2091203?detail=fileexchange
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for Data Science and Analysis opportunities near Copenhagen, Denmark. Remote work is also a possibility.
